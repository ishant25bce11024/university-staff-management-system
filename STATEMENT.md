#Problem statement
Managing university data for teachers, students, and staff can become inefficient and error-prone when handled manually or with disorganized systems. Educational institutions need a unified solution to streamline data entry, modification, retrieval, and administrative tasks related to their personnel and students.​

#Scope of the project
This project provides a menu-driven application for managing key university data. It covers operations for adding, editing, deleting, and displaying information about teachers, students, and non-teaching staff. The scope includes interactive input, reporting, and automated updates for daily administrative tasks, but does not cover advanced analytics, attendance management, or integration with external platforms.​
